Slide 1

In April the Kdenlive team released the 19.04 refactored code edition concluding a 3 year cycle in which more than 60% of the code base was changed with +144,000 lines of code added and +74,000 lines of code removed. This is their biggest release ever bringing new features, improved stability, greater speed and last but not least maintainability (making it easier to fix bugs and add new features).

There is still work to be done! The team concentrated on stability (finding and fixing as many crashes as possible) and that the most important functionality for a slim editing workflow works. There are still known issues in which they will dedicate the next 3 monthly releases of the 19.04 cycle to finish polishing the rough edges.

For the 19.08 cycle the team will add advanced trimming tools as the first item in their roadmap to implement professional grade features. The Titler will get a rewrite as part of a GSOC project, which means that text animations will be back. Also work has started to improve OpenGL support and eventually add GPU accelerated effects.
